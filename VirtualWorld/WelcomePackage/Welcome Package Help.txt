These .iar is a collection of many assets, textures, sounds, and more that are to be used in the Welcome Package.This collection is only for use in Virtual Reality  (not for users connected to a grid with regions).To use this collection, drop the .iar files in bin/WelcomePackage/and then restart Virtual Reality and it will load.NOTE:If you have another .iar in this folder, it is HIGHLY recommended that you remove it, and then run this console command before putting the new .iar in"Clear Welcome Package"This avoids issues with duplicate Welcome Package Assets.This folder is the place where you can add the Virtual Reality Welcome Package .iar files to load to populate your Virtual World.There are over 8,000 inventory files by default, however you can download one (from Virtual Reality) at url coming soon...There will be a help file in there to help you set it up.You can put multiple .iar files to load for the Default Inventory in the folder, however, be careful, as it can cause duplicate folders and items in your Default Inventory.To clear / reset that Asset Library:   On the Aurora console, use the command "Clear Default Inventory"  This will remove all the data and you will then have to reload the libraries.The ViewerDefaultInventory.iar is required for viewers to have their sounds, default textures etc.   Other IAR's can be loaded in afterwards.Remember to remove the IARS after they have been loaded, otherwise they may duplicate after every startup.
