    ;; If you would like to be able to use the console in your viewer (2.x or higher), enable this module
    Enabled = true
    ;; This controls what users can access the console
    ;; To add a new user, type their user name, then put a "|" and put either
    ;;    Read, Write, ReadWrite, None
    ;; This tells the module what permission they have to be able to use the console and should be self explanatory.
    ;; To add another user, just add another "|" after the last ReadWrite permission and repeat.
