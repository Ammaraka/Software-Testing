These .iar is a collection of many assets, textures, sounds, and more that are to be used in the Welcome Package.
This collection is only for use in Virtual Reality  (not for users connected to a grid with regions).

To use this collection, drop the .iar files in 
bin/WelcomePackage/
and then restart Virtual Reality and it will load.

NOTE:

If you have another .iar in this folder, it is HIGHLY recommended that you remove it, and then run this console command before putting the new .iar in
"Clear Welcome Package"
This avoids issues with duplicate Welcome Package Assets.
