 The Virtual Reality Server is an Aurora-Sim, OpenSim, and Taiga-RealXtend derived project with heavy emphasis on supporting all users, 
 increased technology focus, heavy emphasis on working with other developers, whether it be viewer based developers or server based developers, 
 and a set of features around stability and simplified usability for users.

We aren’t just releasing new features, but a new outlook on a virtual world development for the average human.


Mission


Our Mission is to offer high quality virtual world experience..


Overview


Virtual Reality is an experimental and innovative framework containing advanced tools and options for creating virtual world applications. Virtual Reality is not a virtual world, nor a stand-alone application,
it is a scalable and customizable platform containing some basic modules and based on some fundamental innovative pillars (peer-to-peer architecture, secure communication infrastructure, legal framework,
powerful scripting language); additional extensions or expansionpacks can be built on top of it on demand.

The core of Virtual Reality is the innovative Virtual Reality Engine based on a hybrid peer-to-peer infrastructure that allows the sharing of computational load in experiencing the virtual environment,
obtaining infrastructural resource optimization and bandwidth reduction. It enhances the platform in terms of robustness, availability, scalability, load balancing.

From an higher level point of view, Virtual Reality is provided with a Legal Framework that allows to conclude deals and to carry out transaction directly in-world.

To obtain this aim, Virtual Reality is integrated with a secure communication infrastructure based on a strong identity system that bounds the avatar to the real identity of the person behind, that is responsible of his actions as in real life.

In case of infringement of the contract terms, an in-world dispute resolution is implemented within the platform. The design of such system carefully mimics the Model Agreement provided by The International Mediation Institute, www.IMImediation.org.

The main Science & Technology objectives of the project were:

to create a scalable, reliable p2p architecture for a 3d environment: two innovative custom libraries have been developed,
namely vrnet and vrengine that allow the creation of a coherent world on top of a overlay network leveraging on a newly introduced authority mechanism;

to create a secure and trusted infrastructure and a certified authentication system: it allows end-to-end security in communications between either users or participating virtual nodes;
this layer is built upon PKI and stresses the role of mutually entrusted communication streams as well as digital signature of documents and proof of identity;

to implement a virtual law system: leveraging the platform built-in strong identity,
users are allowed to carry out transactions directly in-world (contracts and online dispute resolution system) and to participate to its ruling via customizable Constitution and Law System;

to create a powerful scripting engine, allowing the users to interact with the virtual world. Scripting has been targeted toward programmers, privileging power over ease-of-use;

This innovative approach has received some encouraging feedbacks from private universities and training companies, so that a specific applicative scenario has been customized for educational purposes (Virtual Campus).
The Virtual Campus scenario takes also advantage from the interactivity enabled by the Virtual Reality scripting engine. From the legal side, some Contracts template specifically targeted to the relationships existing among private universities,
teachers and students, cover the main use cases.

Moreover, after a careful examination of potential business applications, thanks to the powerful scripting engine has been possible to obtain a specific applicative scenario (industrial scenario) aimed, for example,
to provide a testing platform for streetcars/railway designers/manufacturers. The project has devoted great attention also on dissemination and exploitation activities;
more than thirty publications have been written and more than one hundred fifty potential stakeholders have been contacted in order to build a business relationship.

Platform Validation has demonstrated that Virtual Reality offers the architectural support for adoption of the platform, whether in autonomous or assisted usage, in educational and industrial application domains (i.e. Virtual Campus and Street-cars).

The validation highlighted some improvements area, in particular with respect to the usability and 3D interaction mode. Notwithstanding this finding, the users in both the domains were able to perform the planned scenarios and the validation exercises.

Virtual Reality demonstrates to be fully compliant with the requirements provided by the pool of involved users. As for Virtual Campus the platform proved to enhance teachers and students to carry out their duties.
In particular the possibility to visualize complex objects, as well as their exploration, and the persistence of the virtual world, were assessed as valuable features to support the educational scenarios.



The experimental results demonstrated that P2P framework effectively balances richness, responsiveness, robustness to provide an enhanced user experience to what is possible on traditional client/server architectures on regular Internet connections.
In addition, our P2P framework reduces the requirements of bandwidth and CPU power on the service provider of a Virtual Reality-based virtual world service, and hence reduces the total cost of ownership.

Virtual Reality aims to provide an immersive and secure environment, combining a high quality 3D virtual experience with the trustiness of a secure communication infrastructure.
Virtual Reality constitutes a new form of civil organization, finalized to the creation of secure and ruled places within the virtual world, where important transactions can occur.
The aggregation in communities and the collaboration between users is encouraged in order to reach a management of common and private interests.
This collaboration is achieved through the definition of common rules that take care of all the involved cultures. A standard collection of laws, the Virtual Reality Constitution,
finalized to the creation and regulation of a secure and trusted environment (Virtual Reality Nation) will be studied. In order to reach high quality 3D metaverses and provide a rich user-experience,
the Virtual World is based on a peer-to-peer network with nodes connected using a secure protocol.

Thus the resulting Virtual World is not hosted on a central server cluster but is based on a network of Virtual Zone Servers (VRZ Servers).
This gives the end-user the full control on the fundamental components of the Virtual Reality Zone Server and the protection of his sensible data.
The peer-to-peer architecture enables easy and fast sharing of contents without third ruling partners: the only ruling entity is the law in force,
defined by the users’ community and accepted by those users who join the community afterwards.

Each VRZ Server simulates all the entities in the zone and gives the users the possibility to create and share contents, media, and data in a very intuitive way.
Virtual Reality constitutes a new form of virtual organization, representing the transition from existing Virtual Worlds administrator-centric to a civil organization ruled by a common “jus gentium” within an immersive,
high quality, 3D Virtual Reality environment. Democratic and decentralized administration Virtual Reality platform will be made of Virtual Reality Zones.

The project includes two kinds of Virtual Reality Zones: stand-alone zones, zones belonging to a Virtual Reality Nation. Stand-alone zones are under exclusive control of their owner:
he/she is the only one deciding the rules, constraints and laws (even none) that avatars visiting the zone must observe, while zones belonging to a Virtual Reality Nation, when joining it,
should accept the constitution and the law in force in that specific Nation. This means that the user is totally free, after having created her/his own Virtual Reality Zone, she/he can decide to be independent or,
on the contrary, to adhere to an existing Virtual Reality Nation, and adhering to its rules, in order to take advantage of all the services it provides.

Technically speaking, a Virtual Reality Nation and all the zones that join it need the existence of a central server in which all the features of the nation are hosted according to the Virtual Reality Constitution that regulates that specific Nation;
while standalone zones are simply created by a user in her/his pc and do not need to be connected to any server at all.

Virtual Reality Legislation

There are several problems concerning the economic system in virtual worlds (legal classification of virtual goods, copyright on user generated virtual objects etc.). With regard to these problems, most of the virtual economic systems provide only insufficient answers,
which lead to a high grade of legal uncertainty. Virtual Reality is based on a completely different approach to these kind of issues. Users joining a trusted, reliable Virtual Reality Nation adhere to a given set of rules, the "Constitution", and are identified by a digital certificate.
The virtual identity of actors and the economic transactions between them are thus guaranteed by the Virtual Reality Nation entity, using established identification mechanisms and network encryption. If democracy is at the basis of Virtual Reality platform,
Virtual Reality Constitutions will be the pillars of Virtual Reality Nations, in fact the creation of a proper set of known and accepted rules is the way for guaranteeing a transparent and fair system.

Virtual Reality Project aims at creating the first proper virtual constitution ever created. The certainty of users' identities and the traceability of all transactions will generate a much higher grade of legal certainty, which will allow a much more serious kind of economic transaction.
Each Virtual Reality Nation will be requested to have a constitution. Safe and secure communication Besides the demand for a more democratic platform, it is easily predictable that Virtual worlds widespread diffusion in the future will depend also on the level of security that the virtual infrastructures will offer.

Virtual Reality project will bring an evolution in the security infrastructure, working on the security level of the accesses. Users accessing Virtual Reality will be divided into 3 main categories: guest user standard user user with outside certification The guest user might be interested in a "test run" of the system,
or might want to attend a single virtual event without going through the registration. It is a sort of virtual tourist, who can't do anything else apart from having a look, experience the world and take part in public chat. The standard user, who has to register and apply for a personal key, has a permanent profile and inventory in Virtual Reality world.
The key is signed by the Virtual Reality Certification Authority; this signature will then be a proof of Virtual Reality Citizenship. The certification policy of the Virtual Reality Certification Authority will not be strict. Every user can register without proving real-life identity or age. Standard users are not directly identifiable in the real world.
However, since they use the same key in their transactions, they can be traced and later indirectly identified. User having an outside certification, released by an external Certification Authority, thus having better identification capabilities, will be able to enjoy advanced services, such as trusted electronic banking or government services
